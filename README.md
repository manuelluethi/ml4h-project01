# ML4H Project
This repository contains my approach to an exercise posed in the Machine 
Learning for Health Care course at ETHZ in 2025. This is ongoing work 
and intended for exploratory purposes only.

# Requirements
It is assumed that the data has been downloaded in .zip format from 
[https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2012/1.0.0/](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2012/1.0.0/) 
and extracted into the root directory of the repository. We also assume 
that ``set-c.tar.gz`` has been extracted.
